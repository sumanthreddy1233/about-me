 About my masters

Hello, I am a junior pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a mobile computing emphasis.

 About his residence

I was raised in a small, rural town called Kearney- not to be confused with Kearney, NE! Our town is a big sports town to where we only talk about football or the weather (interesting conversations, I know).  I was a track and cross country runner my entire time there- which explains my patience and tenacity for programming errors!   Computers were so third world in my town; fortuitously, my father is a software architect so I grew my affinity for technology from him!  Today, I still loving running and coding, so I guess much hasn't changed!

 

 My career aspirations are ambitious but simple: to acquire a position in software architecture like my father.  I always loved designing and analyzing solutions as well as learning new technologies/ development paradigms.  It is my goal to learn as many languages, platforms, and design patterns I can to better prepare myself for what is to  come!  I am allured to web and application development.  I aimed to be a full stack developer ( develop both front-end and back-end deliverables)- hence why I'm here!

 

Something interesting about myself? In spite of being a programmer I hate playing video games all day (mind blowing right)?  Feel free to check and add my linkedin account! I look forward to having fun learning with you all!
